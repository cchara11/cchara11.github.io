            The purpose of the currrent questionnaire is to evaluate a custom lip-sync animation component that was implemented as part
            of a Thesis Master project. 
            The component will be compared against two commercial lip-sync animation programms:<p style="font-size:30px">RogoDigital, Face-FX</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            The questionnaire is divided into two parts, each one consisted of 36 videos. There are 9 scenarios for female models (18 videos) and 9 scenarios for male models (18 videos).
            In each scenario you will have to choose your preffered animation. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Your preference should be based on the following three parameters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>The animation looks realistic</p></li>
                <li><p>The animation is synchronized with the audio</p></li>
                <li><p>The animation is identified by the audio</p></li>
            </ul> 
            <br>
            <p style="font-size:30px">IMPORTANT NOTE:</p> <p>There are some videos that have different rendering. Since the purpose of the questionnaire is to evaluate 
            the mouth during animation, please ignore the model's appearance and focus only on the mouth part.</p>
