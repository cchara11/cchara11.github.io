            The purpose of the currrent questionnaire is to evaluate a custom lip-sync animation component that was implemented as part
            of a Thesis Master project. 
            The component will be compared against two commercial lip-sync animation programms:<p style="font-size:30px">RogoDigital, Face-FX</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            There are two sections, each one consisted of 34 videos. There are 17 videos for female models and 17 videos for male models.
            In each scenario you will have to choose your preffered animation. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Your preference should be based on the following three parameters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>The animation looks realistic</p></li>
                <li><p>The animation is synchronized with the audio</p></li>
                <li><p>The animation is identified by the audio</p></li>
            </ul> 
            <br>
            <p style="font-size:30px">IMPORTANT NOTE:</p> <p>There are some videos that have different rendering. Since the purpose of the questionnaire is to evaluate 
            the mouth during animation, please ignore the model's appearance and focus only on the mouth part.</p>
            <p>Notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>The audio for scenarios 9.1 & 9.2, was obtained by the public domain audiobooks <a href="https://librivox.org/">LibriVox</a></p></li>
